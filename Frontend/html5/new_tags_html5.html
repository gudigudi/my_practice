          &ldquo;Never give someone a chance to say no when
          selling your product.&rdquo;

        The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed,
        they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be
        somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have
        to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions
        that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service
        plan, don't ever ask &ldquo;Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year
        service plan?&rdquo; Instead, ask &ldquo;Are you interested in the 3
        year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?&rdquo;
        At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while
        a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of
        the second question because they have to say more than just
        &ldquo;no.&rdquo;
